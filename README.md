### Map editor

The map editor is a graphical tool built with Pygame that allows users to create and customize simulation environments. Key features include:
- Incorporating specific building types as path destinations.
- Designing routes between buildings for agent movement.
- Customizing environment-specific details.

The editor provides a user-friendly way to design layouts for virus spread simulations.
